# Performance test of web app race condition tools 
The repository contains a script for evaluating the performance of web app race condition tools including a number of results and figures. How the scripts can be used is explained in the Master Thesis: "Towards Systematic Black-Box Testing for Exploitable Race Conditions in Web Apps".

* `gather_test_results.py` is used to test the applications and gather the results. These results are stored in the folder `results`.
* `process_test_results.py` is used to calculate the statistics of the results as shown in `statistics_output.txt` and the figures in the folder `figures`.
